# To-Do List

- [ ] Port `IsInvariant` and `inv_def'` from InvariantSubset.lean
- [ ] Port `univ_is_inv` and `empty_is_inv'` from InvariantSubset.lean
- [ ] Port the whole ENNRealLog.lean
- [ ] Port the whole ERealMulCont.lean incorporating the auxiliary lemmas into the main theorem proof + golfing + PR to to the file on multiplication on EReal.
- [Â ] Port the whole ERealDiv.lean
- [ ] Port Misc.lean to WithBot, PR to logical files. Up to `open Filter`: golf check + put on the file EREals. After `open Filter` put on the file EReal.Filter (+ directory for EREal?)
- [ ] Port the whole DynamicalUniformity.lean: necessary cleanup.
- [ ] Port the whole DynamicalDover.lean: choose a good name for cover entropy
