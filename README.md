I am assuming you have already lean4 and mathlib4 installed.
If not, [start here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/).

To start your project, clone this repo with
```
git clone https://github.com/mseri/lean-mathlib4-starter.git PICK_A_NAME
```
then enter the folder
```
cd PICK_A_NAME
```
and download mathlib's cache with
```
lake exe cache get
```

You can now create any subfolder and add lean files around and it should all work fine.
