## Birkhoff's ergodic theorem in LEAN4

I am assuming you have already lean4 and mathlib4 installed.
If not, [start here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/).

To start your project, clone this repo with
```
git clone https://github.com/mseri/birkhoff.git
```
then enter the folder
```
cd birkhoff
```
and download mathlib's cache with
```
lake exe cache get
```

The project file is `Birkhoff.lean`.
